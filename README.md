  # Fan RPM's
  
  This digital measurement extension will measure RPM's of a fan's TACH signal.
  Most fan's that provide a TACH signal wire will be an open collector type (pull down to ground),
  and will activate twice per revolution.

  This Measurement will measure the amount of falling edges in your measurement selection, and 
  provide you with the RPM's measured during that window of time.
